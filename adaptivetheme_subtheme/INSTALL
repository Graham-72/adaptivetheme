  
  Intallation and setup is totally different from the first version of Adaptivetheme, 
  this is because now we only use subthemes. 

  There is no need to touch the base theme at all.

  1) Copy and past the included starter subtheme (adaptivetheme_subtheme) 
     to your sites/all/themes folder or where ever you are installing your theme.

  2) Rename the theme folder and info file to your preferred theme name, 
     then open up the info file and change the name and description.

  3) Open up your subthemes template.php file and search/replace all instances 
     of “adaptivetheme_subtheme” with your new theme name (there are 6 instances).

  4) Open up your subthemes theme-settings.php file and locate this functions: 

       function adaptivetheme_subtheme_settings($saved_settings) {
         // Get the default values from the .info file.
         $defaults = adaptivetheme_theme_get_default_settings('adaptivetheme_subtheme');

     a) You must first RENAME the function to match your theme name, and:
     b) replace the instance of ('adaptivetheme_subtheme') with ('mytheme').
     
        It should look like this when you are done:

        function mythemename_settings($saved_settings) {
          // Get the default values from the .info file.
          $defaults = adaptivetheme_theme_get_default_settings('mythemename');

  5) If you want to use the color schemes features open up the info file, 
     scroll to the bottom and change settings[color_enable_schemes] = ‘off’ to ‘on’.

     Now you can enable the theme as per usual.
