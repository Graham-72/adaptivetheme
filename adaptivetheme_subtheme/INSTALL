Intallation and setup is totally different from the first version of Adaptivetheme, 
this is because now we only use subthemes. 

There is no need to touch the base theme at all.


1) Copy and past the included starter subtheme (adaptivetheme_subtheme) 
to your sites/all/themes folder or where ever you are installing your theme.


2) Rename the theme folder and info file to your preferred theme name, 
then open up the info file and change the name as well.


3) Open up your subthemes template.php file and search/replace all instances 
of “adaptivetheme_subtheme” with your new themes name (there are 6 instances).


4) Open up your subthemes theme-settings.php file and search/replace all instances 
of “adaptivetheme_subtheme” with your new themes name - there are 2…

One in the function (you must rename the function) and one below it on line 22:

function adaptivetheme_subtheme_settings($saved_settings) {
 
  // Get the default values from the .info file.
  $defaults = adaptivetheme_theme_get_default_settings('adaptivetheme_subtheme');

NOTE: if the advanced theme settings dont show up on your themes configuration page,
chances are you forgot to rename the themeNAME_settings funtion.

5) If you want to use the color schemes features open up the info file, 
scroll to the bottom and change settings[color_enable_schemes] = ‘off’ to ‘on’.

Now you can enable the theme as per usual.
