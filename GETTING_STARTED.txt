# Structure:

  In this directory there are three folders:
  
  - at_core
  - at_admin
  - at_subtheme
  
  AT Core - the base theme, includes the core layout engine and style settings.
  You can safely ignore this theme, its merely there to run in the background
  and do the heavy lifting. For developers the code is well commented and I have
  tried to structure the theme so its easy to follow. Suggestions, improvements
  and of course patches are welcome.
  
  AT Admin - administration theme, use is entirely optional.
  
  AT Subteme - a blank "starterkit" type theme for building your own sub-theme.
  This is the one you need and will be most interested in if you are developing
  a new theme. Instructions are included in the README in this theme.
  
  
# Note from the developer:

  I hope you enjoy this theme and it provides the tools and experience you are
  looking for. I have spent countless hours development Adaptivetheme in the hope
  that it will ease theme development and make your job a little bit more
  enjoyable.

  At some stage you may need support or simply have a question, or even a bold
  new suggestion - please see the issue queue first and submit issues there:
