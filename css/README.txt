  /ie/ie-lte-7.css
    An empty IE stylesheet to support the Conditional Styles module. 
    This module allows themes to specify conditional stylesheets in 
    their info file and the conditional comments will be automatically 
    included at the end of the standard $styles variable. 
    
    Note: You do not need to install the module, it is included inGenesis.
 
    Uncomment or add the required stylesheets in your subthemes .info file.

    such as section, page and body classes, regions, sidebars, header,

    (such as the HTML elements in typography.css), module CSS
